- Freeze while slipping
- Can jump straight toward top when slipping whereas it should jumb perpendicular like when climbing ?
    But maybe it's just that it's always been possible to double-jumb right after jump.
    --> forbid this ? make a waiting period mandatory ?
- Gliding after running is too fast
- Keeping pressing same direction as dash keep dash animation from fading out
